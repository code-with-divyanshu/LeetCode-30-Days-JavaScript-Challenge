# 🚀 LeetCode - 30 Days JavaScript Challenge

## 📅 Day 23: Group By

## 🔥 Problem Statement

🔗 **LeetCode Problem:** [2631. Group By](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-by/description/)

📌 **Description:**  
We need to implement a method `Array.prototype.groupBy(fn)` that groups elements of an array based on a **callback function `fn`** and returns an **object** where keys are generated by the function and values are arrays of matching elements.

- The method must be added to the `Array.prototype`.
- Works for any type of array values.
- Returns an object grouped by the return values of the callback.

## 🧠 Intuition

### 🔥 What is Grouping?

Grouping is a way of organizing array elements into categories based on a given rule. Think of it like creating buckets based on a condition (e.g., group by even/odd, string length, object property, etc.).

🔹 **In this case:**  
We use the return value of `fn(element)` as the group key.

🔹 **Examples:**

| Input                               | Group Function    | Output                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `[1, 2, 3]`                         | `n => n % 2`      | `{ 0: [2], 1: [1, 3] }`                        |
| `['apple', 'ant', 'banana']`        | `word => word[0]` | `{ a: ['apple', 'ant'], b: ['banana'] }`       |
| `[{age: 20}, {age: 25}, {age: 20}]` | `obj => obj.age`  | `{ 20: [{age:20}, {age:20}], 25: [{age:25}] }` |

## 💡 Approach

### **Approach 1: Using a simple `for` loop and an object**

```js
Array.prototype.groupBy = function (fn) {
  let obj = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    let key = fn(this[i]);
    if (obj[key] === undefined) {
      obj[key] = [this[i]];
    } else {
      obj[key].push(this[i]);
    }
  }
  return obj;
};
```

✅ **Pros:**

- Simple and readable.
- Handles all types of grouping logic.
- No external dependencies – pure JavaScript.

## ⏳ Complexity Analysis

| Operation         | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Grouping Elements | **O(n)**        | **O(n)**         |

- One pass through the array (linear time).
- A new object stores all grouped items.

## 📚 Key Concepts to Learn

✅ **Prototype Inheritance** – Extending JavaScript’s `Array.prototype`.  
✅ **Dynamic Object Keys** – Creating keys based on return values.  
✅ **Callback Functions** – Passing logic as an argument.  
✅ **Efficient Iteration** – Using a single loop for grouping.

## 🚀 Best Practices for `groupBy`

🔹 Keep group keys **simple (string/number)** for safe object property access.  
🔹 Avoid prototype modifications in production without a controlled environment.  
🔹 Prefer utility libraries like Lodash for battle-tested alternatives in real projects.
